				<div class="mytext">
					Neuromorphic circuits are specialized electronic circuits aiming to emulate computational paradigms in artificial neural networks (ANNs),
					primarily multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). ANNs are not only capable of solving highly-complicated problems, but also composed of only
					streamlined elemental operations, namely, weighted-sums and nonlinear activations. Since these operations can be easily implemented
					through simple circuits, neuromorphic circuits have garnered significant interest within the EDA community.

				<h4>Difficulties in modeling the neuromorphic circuit?</h4>
				<div class="mytext">
					Although neuromorphic circuits are designed to emulate ANNs, due to physical constraints, not all ANNs can be perfectly mapped into a
					corresponding neuromorphic circuit.
				</div>
				<h5>1. Constraint of the "weights"</h5>
				<div class="mytext">
					Although neuromorphic circuits are designed to emulate ANNs, due to physical constraints, not all ANNs can be perfectly mapped into a
					corresponding neuromorphic circuit. Because the weights are embodied by the resistances through
					<p>$$ w_i = \frac{g_i}{\sum_j g_j},$$</p>
					where \( g_i \) is defined by \( 1/R_i \), named conductance. Therefore, it is evident that the weights, as well as the sum of the weights
					inside a neuron, are necessarily less than one. If the weights in an ANN doesn't meet this constraint, it can not be mapped into a physical
					circuit. Also, as the weights are represented by the ratio of the conductancs, they are coupled with each other, meaning that it is difficult
					to change every single weight value. Therefore, instead of training ANN and converting it into a neuromorphic circuit, we rather directly
					take the conductances as learnable parameters.
				</div>
				<h5>2. Lack of negative resistance</h5>
				<div class="mytext">
					As the weights are emulated by the conductances, they can only be positive values, which impact the expressiveness of the computing system. Therefore,
					to express negative relations, we proposed an inverter-based negation circuit, which can invert the input signal to a negative one, so that the
					negative relationship can be converted to an alternative expression:
					<p>$$ (-w_i)\cdot x_i \to w_i\cdot (-x_i) \to w_i \cdot {\rm neg}(x_i) $$</p>
